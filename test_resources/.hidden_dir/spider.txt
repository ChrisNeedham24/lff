The Japanese spider crab (Macrocheira kaempferi) is a species of marine crab and is the biggest one that lives in the waters around Japan. It has the largest known leg-span of any arthropod around 3.7 meters. The Japanese name for this species is taka-ashi-gani, (Japanese: たかあしがに), literally translating to “tall legs crab”. It goes through three main larval stages along with a prezoeal stage to grow to its great size.[2]

The genus Macrocheira contains multiple species. Two fossil species of this genus have been found, M. ginzanensis and M. yabei, both from the Miocene of Japan.[3][4] Its diverse taxonomic history is an important part of what these creatures are and how they evolved to be what they are today. They are sought by crab fisheries, and are considered a delicacy in Japan. To prevent overexploitation from harming the species, conservation efforts have been put in place to protect these creatures and their population from overfishing.[5]

The Japanese spider crab is similar in appearance to the much smaller European spider crab (Maja squinado), though the latter, while within the same superfamily, belongs to a different family, the Majidae.
